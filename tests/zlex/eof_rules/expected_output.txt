This is test file #1

-------------------------------------------------

We will now include test #2 in a standard way.

INCLUDE #2

This is the second file that will
be included.

>>> Foo are GNU?

INCLUDE #3

This is the third file that will
be included.

>>> echo "I am `whoami`!!"




-------------------------------------------------

And now we will include test # 2 with a different
format

INCLUDE #2

This is the second file that will
be included.

>>> Foo are GNU?

INCLUDE #3

This is the third file that will
be included.

>>> echo "I am `whoami`!!"



-------------------------------------------------

and this is the end of the test.
